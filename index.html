  <p>In life you will undoubtedly face many challenges. 
    Remember that regardless of how hard you fall or fail, the only thing that really matters is that you get up and accomplish.</p>
    <p></p>
  <p>This is one of my most favorite quotes:   How many times have you noticed that it's the little quite moments in the midst of life that seem to give the rest extra-special meaning? ~by Fred Rogers.</p>
